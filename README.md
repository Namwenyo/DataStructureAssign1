**Ordered Array Data Structure**

**COS3711 – Data Structures and Algorithms

Programming Lab – Week 2**

**Instruction**
During this practical session, you are required to create an application that uses
an Ordered Array Data Structure to implement a Personal Library Organizer. The
objective of the assignment is to design and implement a personal library
organizer that uses an ordered array data structure to manage a collection of
books, musical records, etc. The assignment will help to solidify your
understanding of the Ordered Array data structure and demonstrates how its
concepts can be applied.
**Requirements:**
• Create an object class with attributes such as title, author, year, and genre.

You can a record identifier for ordering purposes.
• Use appropriate methods to display the details of the object.

• Create a Library class that will represent the personal library.

• Implement an ordered array data structure to store a collection of your
selected objects in ascending order based on the year attribute.

• Include methods to add a new records to the library, remove an item, and
display the list of items in the library.

**User Interaction:**
• Develop a simple console-based user interface (application) to interact with
the library. Your application must allow users to add a new record, remove
a record, find a record, and view the list of records in the library.

**Sorting:**
Ensure that the ordered array remains sorted after each insertion or removal of a
book. You may use a suitable sorting algorithm or implement a method within the
Library class to maintain the order efficiently.

**Additional Features (Optional):**
Implement a search functionality to find a record by title, author, or genre.
Allow users to update the details of an object.
Add the ability to save and load the library data to/from a file.
Ensure that you application at the minimum has the following methods:

a. Insert – to add data to the library

b. Size – to determine the amount of records in the library

c. Remove – to delete data from the library

d. Find – to determine whether the library contains specified record

e. Display – to iterate over the array and display all data in the library

f. Sort – to rearrange records in the library
